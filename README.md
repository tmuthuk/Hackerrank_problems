Anyone with a fair analytical knowledge can solve a problem. But only a passionate software programmer can "ENGINEER" the code.</br>  

ENGINEERING a code has several different qualities : </br>
1. The code has to be written in such a way that it runs efficiently and in the smallest amount of time </br>
2. All the corner cases has to be covered.</br>
3. Follow the Naming conventions </br>
4. The algorithmic complexity should be as minimal as possible</br>
5. Should be properly commented</br>
6. Follow DRY principle ("Don't repeat yourself")</br>


So through this programming workout I'm putting myself to test all the above mentioned qualities. End of the day, the more you practice, the more you get better at it !!
