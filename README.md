Anyone with a fair analytical knowledge can solve a problem. But only a passionate software programmer can "ENGINEER" the code.  

ENGINEERING a code has several different qualities :
1. The code has to be written in such a way that it runs efficiently and in the smallest amount of time </br>
2. All the corner cases has to be covered.
3. Follow the Naming conventions
4. The algorithmic complexity should be as minimal as possible
5. Should be properly commented
6. Follow DRY principle ("Don't repeat yourself")


So through this programming workout I'm putting myself to test all the above mentioned qualities. End of the day, the more you practice, the more you get better at it !!
